# What is and Why Shell Scripting

To all the **Linux** users *CLI* and its commands are something very familiar or something that they should make familiar :wink:

Simply Shell Scripting is something which ease up your use of command line tasks by combining a series of commands upon our requirements.

## To successfully execute a shell script, we need to :
* Write it properly.
* Provide necessary permission for the Shell to execute.
* Store it in a proper location.
